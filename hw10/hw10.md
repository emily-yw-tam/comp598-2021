# Task 2: Highs and Lows

*Insert any comments, or just NA*

**What were the highlights of the class?**

I thought the lectures were really interesting and provided a good introduction to data science.  The course was well-organized and easy to follow.

**What could have been done better? How?**

I would have appreciated some lectures to be more in depth.  However, I understand that there is a time constraint on lectures so unless the course credit value could be increased to 4, then it would likely be difficult to add more content.  

Although it was helpful to have many assignments to learn new skills, it would have been nice if we were able to drop 1 or 2 assignments, especially during weeks where work load for other classes was quite high.  Another alternative solution would be to have larger weight assignments that cover more material, and are spaced out more throughout the semester rather than being due weekly.  These longer, more complex assignments could also be discussed at length in job interviews or listed on resumes as completed projects.

**How did this course impact the future you see for yourself?**

This assignment provided a solid introduction to the field of data science.  In the future, I hope to take more courses related to data science and could see myself pursuing a job in this field.
