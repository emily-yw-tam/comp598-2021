# Task 1: Data Science Careers

*Look around the internet for data science-related job postings. Pick three that are appealing to you and write a
paragraph about why youâ€™re interested in them (one paragraph for all three). Include a screen capture of each
job posting.*

**MICROSOFT: Data & Applied Sciences: Full Time Opportunities for University Graduates**

https://careers.microsoft.com/students/us/en/job/1115481/Data-Applied-Sciences-Full-Time-Opportunities-for-University-Graduates

**Responsibilities:**

As a Data Scientist, you will formulate approaches to solve problems using well-defined algorithms and data sources. You will incorporate an understanding of product functionality and customer perspective to provide context for those problems. You will use data exploration techniques to discover new questions or opportunities within your problem area and propose applicability and limitations of the data. Successful Data Scientists will interpret the results of their analysis, validate their approach, and learn to monitor, analyze, and iterate to continuously improve.   

You will engage with peer stakeholders to produce clear, compelling, actionable insights that influence product and service improvements that will impact millions of customers. As a Data Scientist, you will also engage in the peer review process and act on feedback while learning innovative methods, algorithms, and tools to increase the impact and applicability of your results.

# Task 2: Highs and Lows

**What were the highlights of the class?**

I thought the lectures were really interesting and provided a good introduction to data science.  The course was well-organized and easy to follow.

**What could have been done better? How?**

I would have appreciated some lectures to be more in depth.  However, I understand that there is a time constraint on lectures so unless the course credit value could be increased to 4, then it would likely be difficult to add more content.  

Although it was helpful to have many assignments to learn new skills, it would have been nice if we were able to drop 1 or 2 assignments, especially during weeks where work load for other classes was quite high.  Another alternative solution would be to have larger weight assignments that cover more material, and are spaced out more throughout the semester rather than being due weekly.  These longer, more complex assignments could also be discussed at length in job interviews or listed on resumes as completed projects.

**How did this course impact the future you see for yourself?**

This assignment provided a solid introduction to the field of data science.  In the future, I hope to take more courses related to data science and could see myself pursuing a job in this field.
